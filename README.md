# Portfolio

A portfolio of my work at school or at other places.

##Some rules for myself:
* Every program will be re-programmed and not what was originally done.
* Every program will still be in the original programming language as when I was assigned it or given as a project.
  * This means that a C program will be in C, a C# program will now be in C#
* If it was a class assignment, no rubric will be included.
